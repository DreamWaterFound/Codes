# Irrlicht Test

Just a test for Irrlicht 3D engine, to find out why the "LocalView" window in OpenRatSALM can not work normally under the ROS. Specifically, the callback function binded to a topic subscribed imgae can not be called when the opreations of createing and drawing window in irrlicht are enabled.

Tested with irrlicht 1.6.1.

This is the version without ROS.

Good Luck ; )
